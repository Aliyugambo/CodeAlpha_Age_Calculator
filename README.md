## AGE_CALCULATOR ##

a web-based Age Calculator using JavaScript to calculate users' ages based on their submitted date of birth, month, and year. JavaScript's built-in date and time functions simplify the age calculation process, making it easy to determine someone's age.

## How It Works ##

### HTML ###
> A simple form collects the user's birth date (day, month, year) with number input fields. When the    user submits the form, it calls the JavaScript code.

### CSS ###
> Basic styling for the form and result area to make the UI look neat and centered.

### JavaScript ###
> It captures the form input values and calculates the age using the current date.
A helper function isValidDate() checks if the entered date is valid.
The result (age) is displayed on the page.
